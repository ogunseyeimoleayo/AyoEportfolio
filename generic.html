									<p>In Unit 1, there were details on the different components of Information Security right from the business strategy to the operations point of view and how they are all interrelated. Reading through the course lecture cast, I enjoyed acquiring information on the history of ISM. In depth knowlegde of the CIA triad while assessing threats and vulnerabilities. I got to apply the application threat modelling tools STRIDE and DREAD which are used to classify and rate risks respectively. At the end of the unit I had more visibility into different career options in information security.</p>
									<p>In Unit 2, I had the opportunity to collaborate extensively with my team members on the case study (Compromising a medical mannequin) which gave a lot of insights as to what challenges the medical parastatals face in the rapidly growing cyber world. Compared to other institutions, the medical institutions is highly volatile as cyber attacks can lead to death of patients. There is a need to create more awareness in this space so as to encourage business leaders to invest on next generation application tools to secure their platform and processes not forgetting the need to educate IT personnels on applying the advised industry approved security standards. </p>
									<p>Unit 3 was particularly interesting for me as I have deep experience as a network engineer on networking fundamentals. Reading through the lecture cast, I was able to refresh my knowledge on the OSI Model, TCP/IP ,the tools used as part of the Internet Protocol Suite and IPV4/IPV6 addressing system. </p>
									<p>In Unit 4,I practiced with my team on using the ping ,traceroute, nslokup tools for basic troubleshooting. These tools help to create more visibility on the underlying infrastrucuture and help to build a case with respect to top level management decisions on the underlay/overlay network</p>
									<p>In Unit 5, I refreshed my memory on the different network devices (switches, routers) and how we transitioned to the current Next generation firewalls. The different service options on the cloud platform coupled with the issues experienced were discussed. </p>
									<p>In Unit 6, we had the development team project where we collaborated extensively on an e-commerce site to find out vulnerabilities and recommendations for possible mitigations. </p>
									<p>In Unit 7, I understood the overall concept of risk and how it drives the business in relation to business continuity and disaster recovery strategies. I also got to widen my knowledge on the overall concept of GDPR,PCIDSS,COBIT and ITIL</p>
