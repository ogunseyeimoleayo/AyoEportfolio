									<p>In Unit 1, there were details on the different components of Information Security right from the business strategy to the operations point of view and how they are all interrelated. Reading through the course lecture cast, I enjoyed acquiring information on the history of ISM. In depth knowlegde of the CIA triad while assessing threats and vulnerabilities. I got to apply the application threat modelling tools STRIDE and DREAD which are used to classify and rate risks respectively. At the end of the unit I had more visibility into different career options in information security.</p>
									<p>In Unit 2, I had the opportunity to collaborate extensively with my team members on the case study (Compromising a medical mannequin) which gave a lot of insights as to what challenges the medical parastatals face in the rapidly growing cyber world. Compared to other institutions, the medical institutions is highly volatile as cyber attacks can lead to death of patients. There is a need to create more awareness in this space so as to encourage business leaders to invest on next generation application tools to secure their platform and processes not forgetting the need to educate IT personnels on applying the advised industry approved security standards. </p>
									<p>Unit 3 was particularly interesting for me as I have deep experience as a network engineer on networking fundamentals. Reading through the lecture cast, I was able to refresh my knowledge on the OSI Model, TCP/IP ,the tools used as part of the Internet Protocol Suite and IPV4/IPV6 addressing system. </p>
									<p>In Unit 4,I practiced with my team on using the ping ,traceroute, nslokup tools for basic troubleshooting. These tools help to create more visibility on the underlying infrastrucuture and help to build a case with respect to top level management decisions on the underlay/overlay network. <a href="Seminar 3 Notes.txt">Seminar notes</a></p>
									<p>In Unit 5, I refreshed my memory on the different network devices (switches, routers) and how we transitioned to the current Next generation firewalls. The different service options on the cloud platform coupled with the issues experienced were discussed. </p>
									<p>In Unit 6, we had the development team project where we collaborated extensively on an e-commerce site to find out vulnerabilities and recommendations for possible mitigations. </p>
									<p>In Unit 7, I understood the overall concept of risk and how it drives the business in relation to business continuity and disaster recovery strategies. I also got to widen my knowledge on the overall concept of GDPR,PCIDSS,COBIT and ITIL</p>
									<p>In Unit 8, I focused on understanding and applying the GDPR and PCIDSS concepts on different case studies and provide mitigation steps to the issues encountered.    </p>
									<p>In Unit 9, I learnt about the most important techniques used in security incident investigations which are logging and forensics and how critical it is in providing insights. This is my first time learning about forensic tools and to see that there are unique tools used to address different events was really insightful I intend to do more research on this topic to further widen my knowlege.   </p>
									<p>In Unit 10, In this unit I got the opportunity to go through the Easy Jet case study which was the option I chose. Reading through a security breach that occured in 2020 to this company and how the data on 9 million customers could be manipulated and used for online scams was an eye opener to the layers of security measures advised for individuals to mitigate against being a target to these security incidents. I enjoyed and learnt quite a lot from this unit </p>
									<p>In Unit 11, I had the opportunity to review the future of security and the emerging technolgies. I learnt about network virtualization and the downsides of using this technlogies alongside mitagating factors to take advantage of the value given.</p>
									<p>In Unit 12, I summed up all of the learning from previous units and learnt around the future potentials of the internet capabilities. </p>
